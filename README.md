# batchext
bash batch file extension rename

* give a working directory
* give current extension
* give new extension
* all of the files with the current extension are changed to the new one

# Bugs

* lets you enter any "extension" as long as it begins with "."
* doesn't recurse into other directories (blessing in disguise?)
